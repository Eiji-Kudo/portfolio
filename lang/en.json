      "title": "Design, Operation & Optimization of Service Runtime Infrastructure",
      "p1": "Designed and built production infrastructure including container runtimes such as EKS and ECS, covering CD, observability, scaling, and security.",
      "p2": "Built ArgoCD-based deployment environments and established GitOps through Helm management, constructed ECS infrastructure for FANME's core services, ensured observability across all services with Datadog APM, enabled auto-scaling with HPA and Cluster Autoscaler, and improved production stability by isolating CronJob workloads. Also hardened security by remediating credential management vulnerabilities and configuring RDS audit logs.",
      "p3": "Reduced backend memory usage by 10% through query redesign eliminating N+1 issues and implementing staged data fetching. Automated IaC operations by building Terraform CI/CD pipelines.",
      "note": "Led planning and execution of ~20% infrastructure cost reduction:",

    "card2": {
      "title": "Building Type-Safe & Testing Infrastructure for Speed and Quality",
      "p1": "Built an auto-generation pipeline from Kotlin → OpenAPI → typed HTTP clients. Also established automated testing infrastructure for both backend and frontend, and created testing guidelines with appropriate granularity based on past bug cases.",
      "p2": "This reduced type-mismatch bugs and cut manual verification effort. Achieved a type-safe development workflow that detects API inconsistencies at compile time.",
      "p3": "Additionally built architecture tests to detect Clean Architecture violations and automated test environments using test DBs. Established a TDD foundation compatible with AI coding tools, accelerating the development cycle.",
      "note": "Led the initiative from proposal to CTO and team members through to adoption. Organized study sessions to help the team adopt it naturally."
    },
    "card3": {
      "title": "Designing, Building & Scaling AI Coding Infrastructure Across the Team",
      "p1": "Codified project-specific coding conventions, architectural design intent, and prohibited patterns in AGENTS.md. Documented both abstract principles and concrete rules, building a foundation that enables AI to make appropriate decisions even in unfamiliar cases.",
      "p2": "Designed and implemented 25+ Custom Skills to automate PR review, planning, and quality check phases. Built a skill suite covering the entire development cycle — including parallel critical PR analysis by specialized reviewers, exhaustive similar-issue detection, QA checklist generation, and sequential lint → type check → test execution with auto-fix.",
      "p3": "Built infrastructure to auto-deploy isolated preview environments per PR for rapid verification of AI-generated PRs. Reviewers can start validation by simply accessing a URL, enabling simultaneous verification of multiple AI-generated PRs.",
      "note": "Since preferred AI tools vary by individual, designed and shared tool-agnostic content such as AGENTS.md writing guides and Skills creation examples. Drove continuous team enabling through study sessions, pair programming, and gradual adoption."

    "card4": {
      "title": "Designing & Building Backend Systems with Managed Services",
      "p1": "For AI generation features (images/videos) requiring 1+ minute processing times, designed and built an SQS-based async processing infrastructure to achieve fault tolerance impossible with synchronous APIs.",
      "p2": "Designed and built a toC authentication system using ElastiCache (Redis). Proposed and adopted a proxy authentication approach, eliminating the need for dedicated authentication screens."
