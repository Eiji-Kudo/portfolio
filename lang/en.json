      "title": "Design, Operation & Optimization of Service Runtime Infrastructure",
      "p1": "Designed and built production infrastructure including container runtimes such as EKS and ECS, covering CD, observability, scaling, and security.",
      "p2": "Established GitOps with ArgoCD Helm management, ensured observability across all services with Datadog APM, enabled auto-scaling with HPA and Cluster Autoscaler, and improved production stability by isolating CronJob workloads. Also hardened security by eliminating shared PEM keys and configuring RDS audit logs.",
      "p3": "Reduced backend memory usage by 10% through query redesign eliminating N+1 issues and implementing staged data fetching. Automated IaC operations by building Terraform CI/CD pipelines.",

      "title": "Building Type-Safe & Testing Infrastructure for Speed and Quality",
      "p1": "Built an auto-generation pipeline from Kotlin → OpenAPI → typed HTTP clients. Also established automated testing infrastructure for both backend and frontend, and created testing guidelines with appropriate granularity based on past bug cases.",
      "p2": "This reduced type-mismatch bugs and cut manual verification effort. Achieved a type-safe development workflow that detects API inconsistencies at compile time.",
      "p3": "Additionally built architecture tests to detect Clean Architecture violations and automated test environments using test DBs. Established a TDD foundation compatible with AI coding tools, accelerating the development cycle.",
      "note": "Led the initiative from proposal to CTO and team members through to adoption. Organized study sessions to help the team adopt it naturally."
